# Course description:  
Embedded or “edge” devices with sensors generate a tremendous amount of data every second. 
Sending these data to the cloud for intelligent decision making by machine learning models 
consumes energy and imposes undesired latency and cost. Processing the data locally on the 
edge lowers latency, energy, and cost. This course introduces deep neural network architectures,
such as dense, convolutional, and recurrent networks, and their respective applications and 
training in the cloud. Students then learn to downsize their trained models so they can deploy 
them for inferencing on microcontrollers running on the edge with power and computation constraints. 
Students are encouraged to create their own projects drawing from such fields as agriculture, 
environment, conservation, health, manufacturing, or home automation. Students are expected to have 
embedded systems knowledge equivalent to 18-349 (Introduction to Embedded Systems). This course is 
cross-listed as 18-448 and 18-848C.
